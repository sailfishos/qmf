      Description: |
          The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
          process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
          that interacts with email and mail servers.

          This package contains the development files needed to build Qt applications
          using Qt Messaging Framework libraries.
      Requires:
          - libqmfmessageserver1 = %{version}
          - libqmfutil1 = %{version}
          - libqmfclient1 = %{version}

      Summary: Qt Messaging Framework (QMF) message server support library
      Group: System/Libraries
      Description: |
          The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
          process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
          that interacts with email and mail servers.

          The MessageServer application is a daemon, designed to run continuously while
          providing services to client applications. It provides messaging transport
          functionality, communicating with external servers on behalf of Messaging
          Framework client applications. New types of messaging (such as Instant
          Messages or video messages) can be handled by the server application without
          modification to existing client applications.

          This package contains:
           - the message server support library. It provides assistance in developing GUI
             clients that access messaging data.
           - a server application supporting multiple messaging transport mechanisms.
      Requires:
          - libqtsql4-sqlite

          process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
          that interacts with email and mail servers.

          This package contains the messaging client utility library. It provides
          assistance in developing plugins for the Message Server daemon.

      Summary: Qt Messaging Framework (QMF) client library
      Group: System/Libraries
      Description: |
          The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
          process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
          that interacts with email and mail servers.

          The Client library provides classes giving access to all messages stored on
          the device, via a uniform interface. It simplifies the task of creating
          messaging client applications, and permits other Messaging Framework
          applications to interact with messaging data where appropriate. New types of
          messages can be supported by the library without modification to existing
          client applications.

          This package contains a library for developing applications that work with
          messages.

          process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
          that interacts with email and mail servers.

          The Messages example client application provides an implementation of standard
          functionality for creating and viewing messages.

          This package contains an example client application supporting common
          messaging functionality.
